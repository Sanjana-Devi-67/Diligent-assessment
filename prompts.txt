# Prompts Used to Generate Technical Documentation and Code Base

1. "U see the artifacts to deliver. So basically we have 25 mins to do it. What's the plan. Guide me like I am a beginner. We gotta build from scratch and push to GitHub."

2. "I want all the features of an e-commerce website including authentication login and search functionality."

3. "U think this will impress them?"

4. "Hey give me full proper code for the mentioned task with impressive UI."

5. "Similarly, I want prompts.txt, with whatever prompts I gave you, just like the code we write in README.md for GitHub."

# Additional Clarifying Direction Provided During Development:
- The backend should be built using Node.js and Express.js.
- The frontend should be built using React.js with React Router for navigation.
- Products must be fetched from a backend API endpoint.
- Basic state management should be used to maintain cart functionality.
- Authentication should use JWT and be persisted using localStorage.
- UI should be clean, modern, and responsive without needing a CSS framework.
- Search must be implemented to filter products by name, category, or description.
- Cart should persist in localStorage and support quantity updates and total price calculation.

# Purpose of Prompts
These prompts guided the generation of:
- The backend REST API with authentication and product management.
- The frontend application architecture, routing, UI layout, and cart state logic.
- The overall technical architecture design and implementation details.
